				<p>Hi... I am an aspiring CS student from Amrita Engineering School, Kollam. And I love to find new places but all the lemon that life gave me keeps me home... </p>

				<span>My family holds the typical mallu family standards. My father works really hard as an engineer and my mother the best homemaker. And I have the sweetest little brother whose little mischieves I miss since he grew-up. Me and my family spent most of our time abroad, so i have very few relatives that i am close to, but i love everyone i have..</span>
				<span>Schooling never really worked on me, the biggest achievement it had was teach me this language. Even if the things that they taught me never really made me smart, learning about our past and how the world's seasons change was really interesting.<br><br> When it came to higher studies computer sciences was an obvious choise for me, I really enjoy making new things and finding out how things worked the way they did. In a virtual world it feels like what i can do is limitless.<br><br> I mostly tend to keep to myself and sometimes it gets lonely. But wherever i go i have never failed to find atleast one person who can get me out of my shell. Kinda gives me hope for the world.</span>
				<span>It's obvious that I love to spend my time in a virtual world. But i would jump on the opportunity for an adventure. Recently i have developed a liking to adrenaline-pumping experiences like skydiving, haunted houses and rollercoasters.</span>
